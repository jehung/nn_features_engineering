# Impact of Feature Selection and Feature Transformation on Neural Network Models


## Before You Run the Files
1) This project only uses a set of standard machine learning modules, such as datetime, dateutil, pandas, numpy, sklearn, and imblearn
2) The folders results/Clustering, results/PCA, results/ICA, restuls/RP, and results/RF must be created at the same level as the Python code before running it.
3) The data folders contains sample_orig_2016.txt, sample_svcg_2016.txt, and train_cleaned.csv, must be at the same level as the Python code files


## Explanation of Files

The zip folder includes the following files:

#### Python code files
- `benchmark.py`: Code for benchmarking the neural network
- `clustering.py`: Code for implementing clustering
- `PCA.py`: Code for implementing PCA
- `ICA.py`: Code for implementing ICA
- `RP.py`: Code for implementing Random Projections
- `RF.py`: Code for implementing Random Forest
- `helpers.py`: Helper code on performance evaluation
- `utility.py`: Code to read in and preprocess data

#### Data files
- `sample_orig_2016.txt`
- `sample_svcg_2016.txt`
- `train_cleaned.csv`


#### Resutls folders
- `results/Clustering`: Output folder for the Neural Network experiments
- `results/PCA`: Output folder for the Continuous Peaks experiments
- `results/ICA`: Output folder for the Flip Flop experiments
- `results/RP`: Output folder for the Traveling Salesman Problem experiments
- `results/RF`: folder with source, ant build file, and jar for ABAGAIL
